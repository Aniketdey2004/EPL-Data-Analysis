## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis

### ðŸ”¹ Univariate Analysis

- **Goals Scored (Home & Away):**
  - Most teams score between **0â€“2 goals**.
  - The data is **discrete**, **positively skewed**, and includes **high-scoring outliers**.
  
- **Shots & Shots on Target:**
  - Home: ~10â€“14 shots (3â€“7 on target)
  - Away: ~7â€“11 shots (2â€“5 on target)
  - Distributions are **right-skewed** with notable **outliers indicating dominance**.

- **Fouls & Cards:**
  - Both teams average ~9â€“13 fouls.
  - Home teams show more **instances of clean play**.
  - Yellow Cards: Home (~0â€“2), Away (~1â€“2)
  - Red Cards: Mostly 0, occasionally 1â€“2 (more for home teams)

- **Corners:**
  - Home: 4â€“7 (more frequent), Away: 3â€“5
  - High outliers in both suggest **dominant attacking performances**.

### ðŸ”¹ Categorical Insights

- **Seasons:**
  - 1993/94 and 1994/95 were the **longest seasons**.
  - 2024/25 had the **fewest matches**.
  
- **Match Results:**
  - **Home wins** are the most common result across all seasons.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Bivariate Analysis

- **Goals Relationships:**
  - Strong **positive correlation** between half-time and full-time goals.
  - **Negative correlation** between home and away goals.

- **Shots vs. Goals:**
  - Strong **positive linear relationship**.
  - Shots on target are better predictors of goals than total shots.

- **Corners vs. Goals:**
  - Positive relationship: more corners often lead to more goals.

- **Fouls vs. Shots:**
  - No clear correlation; **fouls donâ€™t significantly impact the opponentâ€™s attacking play**.

- **Match Outcome Predictors:**
  - **High goals, shots, shots on target, and corners** are key indicators of wins.
  - **Fouls and cards** show no strong relationship with match outcomes.

### ðŸ”¹ Referee Analysis

- Top 20 referees by number of matches were visualized.
- **M. Dean** officiated the most matches by far.

## âœ… Key Takeaways

- **Home Advantage is Real:** Home teams generally score more, shoot more, and win more.
- **Shots on Target Are Key:** High correlation with goals, outperforming total shots as a predictor.
- **Corners Reflect Dominance:** Strong link between corners and offensive pressure leading to goals.
- **Dirty Play Patterns:** Outliers in red/yellow cards show aggression under pressure, often from home teams.
- **Referee Influence Exists:** A few referees officiate disproportionately high numbers of matches.
- **Performance Fluctuations:** Teams and matches vary significantly season-to-season, making rolling and seasonal trends critical.
- **Goal-Driven Results:** Goals, especially full-time goals, are the most predictive features for match outcomes.
- **Clean Play Not Always Rewarded:** Fouls and cards do not directly correlate with match results.
- **Consistent Patterns Across Seasons:** Despite varying lengths of seasons, the distribution of performance metrics remains stable.
